# Implementation report

## Delivered vertical slice

ArcadeOps Relay is a self-contained challenge application implementing a real, persisted Project Aurora state machine. The native WebMCP adapter exposes seven intent-level tools. It does not automate the DOM or alias a custom protocol as WebMCP.

The bounded worker is deterministic by design: it creates actual versioned application state and hashed artifacts over synthetic inputs, while using no paid model or external capability. The human decision and delivery acceptance are separate visible UI actions and cannot be invoked through the registered tool surface.

The development browser console reports React's expected CSP warning because development debugging attempts `eval`; production does not use it. The production CSP intentionally omits `unsafe-eval`.

## Security review disposition

Source review identified and fixed two release-blocking control gaps before publication:

1. body size is now enforced on the actual UTF-8 request body, including requests without a trustworthy `Content-Length`;
2. optional run handles supplied to observe, explain, and verify are validated for session, target, version, signature, and expiry.

No validated critical, high, medium, or low application vulnerability remains in the reviewed current source. The prompt-only scan contract was sealed at `2026-09-01T09:12:04Z`; its snapshot digest is `c294a71c8a72aefeec13d7c3fe687c801cd766b6b6af6545730fd7561355641b`. An independent baseline subagent was unavailable under this thread's execution policy, which is recorded as a scan limitation. Deployment assumptions and residual limitations are explicit in `SECURITY.md`.

## Pending publication gates

This report is updated after container deployment, public source clean-clone verification, native browser testing, media inspection, YouTube publication, and Devpost submission. A local pass is not represented as any of those external states.
